# Decentralized Domain Name System (D-DNS)

## Overview

D-DNS is a blockchain-powered, censorship-resistant domain name system that revolutionizes domain ownership and management through decentralized technologies. By leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, D-DNS provides a transparent, secure, and user-controlled domain registration platform.

## Key Features

### 1. NFT-Based Domain Ownership
- Domains are minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Permanent, verifiable ownership recorded on the blockchain
- Easy transferability and tradability of domain assets
- Immutable proof of domain ownership

### 2. Smart Contract Infrastructure
- Automated domain registration process
- Transparent renewal mechanisms
- Programmable domain management
- Built-in escrow and transfer protocols

### 3. Censorship Resistance
- No central authority can seize or disable domains
- Global accessibility
- Protection against arbitrary domain revocation

### 4. Trademark Dispute Resolution
- On-chain arbitration mechanism
- Neutral third-party mediation smart contracts
- Transparent conflict resolution process

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- Blockchain Network: Ethereum/Polygon compatible
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: React/Web3.js
- Backend: IPFS for decentralized storage

### Domain Registration Flow
1. User searches for available domain
2. Domain availability verified on-chain
3. NFT minting upon successful registration
4. Automatic renewal through smart contract escrow

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Metamask or Web3 Wallet
- Hardhat
- Truffle (optional)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentralized-dns.git

# Install dependencies
cd decentralized-dns
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run local blockchain
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK`: Target blockchain network
- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Infura project credentials
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Deployment wallet private key

## Security Considerations
- Implement multi-signature wallet controls
- Regular smart contract audits
- Upgrade mechanisms for contract improvements
- Comprehensive error handling

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement ENS compatibility
- [ ] Multi-blockchain support
- [ ] Enhanced privacy features
- [ ] Decentralized identity integration
